## BILL OF MATERIALS
  ```
  Raspberry Pi Pico W

  A suitable stepper motor driver board (this guide references the driver board in this pack: https://thepihut.com/products/stepper-motor-driver-pack)
  A suitable plastic project box (metal cannot be used as it will block wifi connectivity)
  USB A to Micro USB 2.0 cable
  20 mm diameter heat shrink
  ```
